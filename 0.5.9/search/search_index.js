A decoder for a repeated field may proactively decode all of the elements of that field, if they appear consecutively.</p> Note that decoders may throw any of the following <p>IndexError:  Indicates a truncated message. struct.error:  Unpacking of a fixed-width field failed. message.DecodeError:  Other errors.</p> <p>Decoders are expected to raise an exception if they are called with pos &gt; end.

The sizer takes a value of this field's type and computes its byte size.  The encoder takes a writer function and a value.  It encodes the value into byte strings and invokes the writer function to write those strings.  Typically the writer function is the write() method of a BytesIO.</p> <p>We try to do as much work as possible when constructing the writer and the sizer rather than when calling them.  In particular: * We copy any needed global functions to local variables, so that we do not need   to do costly global table lookups at runtime. * Similarly, we try to do any attribute lookups at startup time if possible. * Every field's tag is encoded to bytes at startup, since it can't change at   runtime. * Whatever component of the field size we can compute at startup, we do. * We avoid sharing code if doing so would make the code slower and not sharing   does not burden us too much.  For example, encoders for repeated fields do   not just call the encoders for singular fields in a loop because this would   add an extra function call overhead for every loop iteration; instead, we   manually inline the single-value encoder into the loop. * If a Python function lacks a return statement, Python actually generates   instructions to pop the result of the last statement off the stack, push   None onto the stack, and then return that.  If we really don't care what   value is returned, then we can save two instructions by returning the   result of the last statement.  It looks funny but it helps. * We assume that type and bounds checking has happened at a higher
